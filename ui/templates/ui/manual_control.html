    <div id="camera_display">
        <p> This is the division where the camera will be displayed. Probably some information overlay with the sensors
            will be done as it will be easier to see for the pilot. A full screen option will be available, and ideally
            linked to a joystick button that needs to be mapped. </p>

    </div>

    <div id="map_display">
        <p> This is the division of the map display in manual mode, if needed it may be a possibility to get it zoomed
            in</p>
    </div>


    <div id="sensor_display">
        <p>This section is used for displaying sensor data that is coming from the drone, such as imu, position,
            pressure(or altitude) and motor speed data, as well as applied PWM if not available</p>

    </div>

    <div id="control_inputs">This section is supposed to show what control inputs the operator is sending to the drone
    </div>

    <div id="drone_state">
